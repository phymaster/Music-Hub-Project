		<h1>Introduction to Our Service</h1>
    <h2>What problem are we solving?</h2>
    <p>8.9 millions+ of undiscovered musical talents are seeking opportunities to show their music to music fans. <br>
      Also, 335 millions+ of young people has needs to explore and enjoy new music. (e.g. massive success of TV audition shows) <br>
      However, current channels (e.g. TV programs, music festivals, online music service) are not efficient enough to resolve the both market needs.</p>
    <h2>Our service concept</h2>
    <p>We have built a new online music distribution/consumption platform service, in the form of "Global music competition service", which aims to efficiently deliver all music from undiscovered musical talents to music fans around the world and provide new opportunities for musicians and new fun for music fans.</p>
